# CatchGame V2

Two player game made with pygame. It is a game of catch where the objective is for the catcher to catch the other player and the other player to get to the objective


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```
## Game flow
P1 starts catching P2, this means that P2 needs to get to the objective. Once P1 catches P2 or P2 reaches the objective, the roles swap, P2 is now the catcher.

## Online Multiplayer
Currently being worked on, the files are available on the work in progress folder
Progress is being made, but a roadblock has been reached
  The velocity of the player is somewhat dependend on the latency in the communication with the server
  Need to investigate about online multiplayer architecture to fix this
